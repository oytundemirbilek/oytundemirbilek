        <h2>Machine Learning Models</h2>
        <p>There are 3 main branches in machine learning: Classification, Regression and Clustering.
          This section is designed to show the most recent kind of implementations of the machine 
          learning models. All you need to do is choose one of the model options and click run.
        </p>

        <h2>Pulsar Star Classification</h2>
        <p>In this work, we aimed to expect model to understand which features are effective as having a major impact
          to decide about a space entity is a pulsar star or not. When the model is available to do that after training, we let it
          to find all pulsar stars on testing data. We measure f1 score to ensure that the model is well trained and making
          correct decisions.</br>
        <h3>Methods</h3>
          <ul>

            <li>Cross Validation</br>
            To obtain a well trained model, we will split data to 10 folds and choose 1 of them as testing data, then we do the
            same thing for all folds. This helps us to see best and worst possible results. For more information, visit academics page.
            </li>

            <li>Decision Tree Classifier</br>
            Decision trees are a flowchart like data structure having nodes as a tests on each attribute, it is one of the most
            powerful and popular tools for binary classification tasks. For more information, visit academics page.
            </li>

            <li>F1 Score</br>
              F1 score is a popular formula to measure the quality of a classification model. When the data includes imbalanced
              numbers of classes(e.g. only 5% is a pulsar star), it is the reason we choose it over measuring accuracy. For more information, visit academics page.
